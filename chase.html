          <h3>Project Background</h3>
          <p>
            Chase, owned by JP Morgan, has one mission to empower customers’
            lives by creating engaged, lifelong relationships. They spend many
            years on providing the most relevant products for their customers,
            but now they want to exceed their customer’s expectations and not
            just provide these products, but also provide them with personalized
            financial management tools within their mobile banking app. As a
            UI/UX designer, I helped in researching and designing features,
            including a budget planner and goal tracking feature based on the
            client's objectives.
          </p>

          <p>
            Given this is a student project, the new features implemented are
            completely hypothetical, and I am not affiliated with Chase Bank.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Why We Should Care?</h3>
          <p>
            Chase realized that many millennials are now switching to mobile
            apps as a finance management tool. However, their app doesn't
            contain the standard features of personal financial management/
            budgeting.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Our Solution</h3>
          <p>
            To provide current Chase customers with easy to use management tools
            including budgeting and goal saving features integrated into their
            existing app.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h3>Market Research Demographics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Twice the number of Millennials indicated increasing their use of
              mobile banking app.
            </li>
            <li>
              73 percent of millennials are saving for life milestones and
              future goals.
            </li>
            <li>
              75% are saving for retirement, while 51% are building an emergency
              fund.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With this information, Millennials need a personal finance
            management tool within their own banking app to help increase their
            growth, to start saving early for retirement and to manage their
            savings.

        <h3>Process</h3>

        <p>
          I followed a Design Thinking approach based on an iterative process to
          explore possible pain points and problems for people who uses mobile
          banking apps like Chase.

          <div class="competitive-analysis">
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              With so many finance apps today, I knew Chase had many
              competitors. I found similar apps that provided an overview of
              features. Competitive analysis was essential to understanding
              strong design patterns and seeking opportunities for growth in the
              market. For example, I noticed how other companies' apps often
              prioritize transactions over budgeting tools. They have many
              useful UI features that brings clarity about their spending and
              savings; however, there is a barrier for users who lack clarity in
              terms of their budgeting and saving goals. With that said, it
              helped me with discovering ways for Chase to be a competitive
              online brand and shedding light as what the existing standard is.
              As a result, this help inform my design by developing new features
              that Chase's competitors are lacking.

          <div>
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>
              As part of my research, I conducted user interviews to become
              familiar with trends in consumer behaviors related to finance,
              discover the main factors that influence consumers’ finances, and
              understand financial goals of our targeted users. For example, I
              wanted to understand more about users' spending patterns and if
              the users use any other finance management tools similar to ours.
            </p>

            <p>
              For each participant, I asked open ended questions to better
              understand user needs and pain points and to collect qualitative
              information from participants. I interviewed 3 females and one
              male ages 20-40 in person, and all participants are currently
              using finance apps like Chase.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first assumption was that users understand budgeting and how to
              manage their money using mobile apps. Conducting primary research
              and meeting with Chase customers made me realize that a number of
              users didn't use any budgeting and goal saving tools on their
              phone mainly due to the complexity of the mobile features and lack
              of interest. Thus, it is important to empathize with the users and
              to solve the users pain points and frustrations and design
              features that will be intuitive, interactive, and effortless.
            </p>

            <!-- <ul>
              <li>
                All participants liked the design because it was fairly easy to
                navigate and it was clear
              </li>

            <!-- <p>
              Through my user testings, I was able to connect with the user
              personally, observe how the user interacts with the app and
              understand the common trends among my participants. Also, I
              revamped my prototype and determined what revisions are needed to
              improve the user experience.

            <h3>UI Kit</h3>
            <p>
              While designing the new features, I focused on Chase's existing
              styles and design patterns to create a familiar experience for
              users. As shown below, I created an UI kit that contains all the
              colors, elements, typography, and components, so I can follow the
              guidelines when designing the app and ensuring that the elements
              of the brand style are cohesive and aligned.

            <h3>High-Fidelity Design</h3>
            <p>
              Next step was the high-fidelity wireframes where I created a
              clickable prototype using Invision and gathered user feedback
              based on the visual presentation and interaction design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on the results from my 1:1 interviews, I thought it was
              interesting to see how users were able to recognize some design
              common patterns from the actual Chase mobile app. In addition, all
              my participants thought the app had a clean and user-friendly
              interface, and adapted to the new features. One participant even
              suggested using automation to transfer funds periodically from
              their savings account to add to their savings goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the iteration process, I often try to put myself in the
              shoes of the participants.

            <h3>Lessons Learned and Next Steps</h3>
            <p>
              Given this was my third UX/UI project, I have more knowledge of
              design tools and how to best conduct a usability testing.It took
              many iterations with testing until the users were able to navigate
              the app with ease. I also learned how to use my research to inform
              design decisions. The hardest part for me is thinking of new
              features. However, after chatting with my participants from the
              user interviews, I had a better idea of what my users need and
              also what their pain points are while using other finance apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next Steps: to perform a second usability testing with the revised
              prototype and refine the design process.
