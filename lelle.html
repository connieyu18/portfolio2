          <h3>Project Background</h3>
          <p>
            Lelle is an app for nutrition lovers to manage their inventory, and
            to keep track of their purchases, products to buy, and also their
            favorite items. This app also helps users track their wellness
            including meals, water intake, exercise and sleep as well as their
            vitamins and supplement consumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lelle Company hopes to create more awareness for nutrition since
            there are many women who are lacking knowledge about health and
            eating food that provide little nutritional benefits. Prevention is
            key when it comes to long sustainable health. If Lelle can help more
            people start eating healthier and taking their vitamins and
            supplements daily, then there will be less visits to the doctor and
            less chronic diseases in the world today.
            <!-- <p> Lelle Company has started collecting data on vitamin and supplement products. They want to allow
                    users to use the flil benefits that a mobile app has such as using the camera to scan products and
                    sending notifications to users to keep them engaged.

          </p>

          <h3>Why We Should Care?</h3>
          <p>
            Lelle realized that many women are using vitamins, supplements, and
            other health products but doesn't have the time or resources to
            manage their daily wellness goals and nutrition products. In
            addition, many of us lose the enthusiasm needed to complete our
            health goals before we cross the finish line.
          </p>
          <h3>Our Solution</h3>
          <p>
            A new mobile app that reflects modern aesthetics and includes a
            personal organizer and a tool for wellness tracking.

            <h3>Competitive Analysis of Different Health Trackers</h3>
            <p>
              There aren't many health inventory apps in the market today as of
              March 2020. I discovered a few nutrition tracker apps but at this
              point I couldn't find many competitors that can track vitamin or
              supplement products as well as wellness.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to stand out from its competitors, the app will need
              strong branding and better tracking features with notifications.
              It’s essential to feature good usability and less requirements.
              This app will also need various UI/ UX features including tracking
              tools, nutrition info, analytics, trends and recommendations.
              Diversity is key. Our app should cater to any demographics
              including non-patients or non-nutrition enthusiasts. Lastly, we
              need a large data collection with hundreds of brands and products
              to be more inclusive.

              I created this diagram to observe the differences and similarities
              in respect to the Business, Tech and User needs. For business
              considerations, Lelle mainly aims to increase engagement which
              requires the tech team to help them create an app with fully
              functioning and intuitive features. Technical and user
              considerations are quite similar in terms of convenience, easy
              navigation, accessibility, and security. All sides need to work
              together as a whole in order to accomplish all goals.

              with an idea on who I should approach and interview when I move
              towards my in-person interviews.

          <h3>User Interviews</h3>
          <p>
            I started the project with research to understand more about trends
            in wellness and health tracking and to uncover the nutritional goals
            of our targeted users.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For each participant, I asked open ended questions in order to
              understand more about the user’s needs and pain points. Some
              research questions include how do users organize their current
              products and how do they monitor their daily health. This
              information can help us understand deeper about the design and
              features that are beneficial for the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              For my user interviews, I found 3 participants both female and
              male who were between the ages 20-40 that are currently using
              vitamins, supplements, or other health products.

              Some participants take over 10 products, such as vitamins,
              supplements, medications and health products and they take these
              products daily.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most don’t track their vitamins or medications intake or use any
              nutrition apps or tracker.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most don’t organize their products and sometimes forget their
              purchases resulting in many expired and wasted products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most people care about their health, but doesn’t have the time to

            <p class="backgroundDetails">
              After the interviews and the secondary research findings, I felt
              like I had a better understanding of Lelle's target demographic
              and created a persona of someone I thought would be a potential
              customer. I wanted to create a persona that included
              characteristics of my interviewees but was also fictional. Loraine
              is our ideal user so her goals, needs, frustrations, and
              motivations were always kept in mind while making design
              decisions.

              I started to look for patterns to identify the user needs and to
              identify who the end users are. I organized into 6 groups by
              grouping similar responses and delivered with valuable insights.
              Based on the insights, I can conclude that the three main trends
              among the users are forgetfulness, overspending and hopes for
              sustainable long term health.

          <p>
            Next, I created a sitemap that would be helpful to illustrate the
            information architecture by showing the features, the main screens,
            and the child screens. The sitemap helps us to also understand how
            screens are connected to each other. Using the site map, I can
            organize all my content of the app and use it towards wireframing.

          <p>
            Then, I created a user flow to illustrate different pathways that a
            user can take to navigate through the app to complete a task. This
            helps me to understand which screens are needed in order for the
            user to have a good user experience. It should flow smoothly as
            users move from one screen to next and it should make sense to the
            user. Using this diagram, I was able to focus on the paths, and
            remember to stay on track with the user goals.

            pages using InVision to create an interactive prototype. The purpose
            of the wireframe was to ensure that the branding was clear and
            contain all the features that the user needs.

            I decided to create a bright and inviting feel for Lelle,
            considering the styles Lelle's users would appeal to. Then, I
            created an UI kit that reflected Lelle's new identity and chose a
            welcoming color palette that fits the female audience. I gathered
            all the elements that I would like to use throughout my app
            including the color palette, typography, and other components.

          <p>
            From my research findings, UI Kit and user feedbacks, I created a
            high-fidelity prototype that allow users to test for functionality
            with given tasks. The plan is to have the user create a 'to buy'
            list for her vitamins and add products to the list. The other
            scenario is to have the user track her wellness and add a tracking
            list for her vitamins.

          <p>
            Coming up with this wireframe was not easy as there are many
            features that I wanted to include, in order to meet the needs of the
            users. I made couple of iterations after my usability testing and
            referred often to the testing results.

          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Usability tesing was conducted to test the usability and navigation,
            discover how users use the mobile app (forms, navigation bar),
            observe how long each participant takes to complete each task, and
            understand the users' experience using Lelle mobile app. With the
            feedback from the participants, I revamped my prototype and
            determine what revisions are needed to improve the user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a total of 3 female participants aged 20-40. I completed
            evaluative research by performing in-person testing using Invision.

          <h3>Usability Testing Results</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The navigation is clear and helpful for finding what the users
              need.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some participants wanted to see the vitamins and dosage when they
              first open the app.
            </li>
            <li>
              The wellness tracker was missing some elements that are helpful
              for women to track such as menstrual cycle, birth control, and
              sleep.
            </li>
            <li>
              Liked the idea of the reminders and thought it can be helpful for

          <p>
            This project was my first mobile app from start to finish. Designing
            a complex project like this app was challenging but it was fun for
            me as I was a nutrition enthusiast. I learned more about secondary
            research and in person interviews which helped me understand more
            about my target market and user needs when it comes to tracking
            nutrition products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next Steps: to perform a second usability testing with the revised
            prototype and refine the design process.
