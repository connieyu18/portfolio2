            <p>
              To get a better feel of my competitors and the target audience, I
              first compared some of the most popular networking apps to
              understand their strengths and weaknesses, and to dive deeper into
              understanding some of their common features and patterns. From my
              research, I couldn't find many direct competitors that provide a
              curated networking platform where board members are able to
              connect with candidates via online meet ups or individual chats.
              <!-- From this insight, I focused on how to increase user traction such
              as adding helpful features like recommendations and connecting

          <h3>User Interviews</h3>
          <p>
            After researching BSM's competitors, I started coming up with
            questions for the target user and wanted to see if they would be
            interested in using an app like BSM and to discover common
            challenges. I then conducted 1:1 user interviews with three
            participants who are considered ideal users of the app. The
            participants whom I interviewed were females and minority groups who
            were looking to become board members or current board member looking
            for new candidates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ultimate goal was to connect user needs to workable solutions
            and tools to assist them with their career.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For each participant, I asked 8 open ended questions to uncover
              user wants, desires and existing frustrations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Key Takeaways: </strong>Connections are hard to find and
              itâ€™s hard to schedule meetings with people who are constantly busy
              like board members. Also, the purpose of becoming board members is
              to build their profile, gain professional skills, and also make a
              difference in their community.
            </li>
            <li>
              As a result of the user interviews, I decided who my target
              audience is- lean females and minorities who are career focused.
            </li>

          <h3>User Persona</h3>

          <p>
            After the interviews, I felt like I had a better understanding of
            BSM's target demographic and created a persona by evaluating the
            feedbacks and observations from the participants responses. My goal
            is to help users like Samantha solve one of their largest challenges
            which is finding opportunities to connect with top leaders.

          <h2>2. Information Architecture</h2>
          <h3>Site Map</h3>
          <p>
            Next, I began thinking about the content and created a sitemap that
            would be helpful to illustrate the information architecture by
            showing the features, the main screens, and the child screens. The
            sitemap helps us to also understand how screens are connected to
            each other. Planning early helps with the next steps of the design
            process. I often referred to the site map when building out my
            prototypes and ensuring the flow of each page was inline with the
            research.

          <h2>3. Interaction Design</h2>
          <h3>User Flows</h3>
          <p>
            With a general idea about the requirements and features needed, I
            created a user flow to illustrate different pathways that a user can
            take to navigate, because I wanted to ensure the interaction design
            would be intuitive to the user. With the user journey in mind, I
            started envisioning each screen's content following this structure.
            I had to put myself in the shoes of a board member or a candidate
            and often refer back to the target users' ultimate goals and
            motivations. Also, I wanted to solve some of the users' pain points
            of setting up meetings and ensuring the user feels secure while
            using the app.
          </p>

          </div>
          <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
          <p>
            After completing the site map and task/ user flows, I began
            wireframing the sketches that I brainstormed. This was a great way
            to test for functionality with given tasks. After producing several
            different versions, I completed 19 wireframe pages including login,
            search, chat, profile, add availability and meetings. Then, I
            connected the pages using InVision to create an interactive
            prototype.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a functional low-fidelity prototype, the users could provide
            feedback on the site's navigation and interaction design rather than
            focusing on the visual design.
          </p>
          <div class="image-center">
            <img
              alt="low-fi"
              style="box-shadow: none"
              class="img-responsive-60"
              src="assets/images/bsm-lofi.png"
            />
          </div>
          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>
            I conducted usability testing to test the usability and navigation,
            discover how users use the mobile app (forms, search, navigation
            bar), observe how long each participant takes to complete each task,
            and understand the users' experience using BSM mobile app. The goal
            is to have users connect 1:1 with either board members or
            candidates. Some tasks include searching, sending requests and
            chatting. With the feedback from the participants, I revamped my
            prototype and determine what revisions are needed to improve the
            user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this testing, it helped me to uncover problems such as
            uncertainly with the forms, discover opportunities or frustrations,
            see if we met the user's expectations, and learn about the users.
            Also, I learned how to ask better questions and focus on user
            actions as well as their comments.

          <h2>4. UI Design</h2>
          <h3>UI Kit</h3>
          <p>
            In this step, I determined the vibe of the app and created an UI kit
            that reflected BSM's brand and chose a welcoming color palette that
            aims for a modern, fresh, and positive feel for BSM. Documenting the
            colors, typography, and components of the app made it easy when it
            came to the visual design process.

          <h3>High-Fidelity Design</h3>
          <p>
            From the low-fidelity wireframes and the comments from the first
            usability testing, I explored different variations to provide a
            better flow for the user and incorporated the strongest elements
            from my mockups. I then conducted a second round of usability
            testing, so users can provide more open feedback on the overall
            design and what works or doesn't work for them. As a result, I
            streamlined the sign-in process with less form fields and a faster
            login process, focused more on consistency and modularity, and
            ensured the navigation is working throughout the app. Below is the
            snapshot I created of the high-fidelity prototype following common
            design patterns and a balance of white space and content.

          <p>
            Given this was my second UX/UI project, I am still learning to use
            the design tools and to perform research with participants. I
            learned what makes good usability in terms of mobile applications
            and also how to best interview your participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next Steps: to perform a second usability testing with the revised
            prototype and refine the design process. If I had more time, I would
            add a calendar feature and also improve on the chat component.
